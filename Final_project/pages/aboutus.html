				<h2>Our Mission</h2>
					<p>We wanted to start a local place so we can have a family feel. 
					Nobody thinks of Grilled Cheese places, so we wanted to be original. 
					When you think of places you usually go with, Italian, Mexican, or stuff like that so
					we wanted to branch out from that. Also we would like to know most of the people who come
					here and make everybody feel welcome.</p>
